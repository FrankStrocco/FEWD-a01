# A bit about me:

Hi, my name is Frank. I'm 44 years old and I used to love to surf and play soccer. Now I like to jog and take pictures of surf when it's big. lol. I should probably get out and surf more, but my shoulders hurt and I can't breath. I just need to stop being lazy. I recently found an old dv tape with footage of me surfing in hawaii. Nothing special, but A few fun waves captured were enough to spark some interest again.


# Computer Stuff I like:
I also enjoy coding and trying to solve _**coding challenges**_. I used to play a lot of video games, but it just seems to be a waste of time, when I can be studying code and making websites to further my skills and career.

### Other things I like are:
* cooking
* looking at art
* reading
* drawing
